## FAQ

You might be wondering who I am or do I **_even exist_**.

I'm <sub>Nomad</sub> or what I use for my name in the internet, I am student from highschool without any knowdledge and no inspiration
I started to learn the language c++, prior to 2 years ago for small knowledge about **javascript** from an certain github repo
soon enough I learned and taught myself how to perfect the language bit by bit learning from the internet and whatnot, This repo
contributes to my hard work and passion for this language yet still I felt not complete and dind't spend much time for myself.
I stopped and took a 1.7 year break and hear I am learning a new yet difficult langauge c++, Hope you'll find this encouraging
and push yourself beyond your limit bit by bit, By far this is the only librabry I could help you in anyway.
